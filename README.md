# pyfun- Why Python Rocks🎸
<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/saudkadiri/pyfun.svg?label=Repo%20size&style=for-the-badge">

#### Aim:
Through this repo I aim to show that programming in Python is fun (doesn't imply that there's something like cpain🙂, infact I have another repo: "cfun" that shows why C simply rules⭐️)

#### Why Python?
Python has made my work really easy; I remember C (my mother tongue) consuming more than a month in studying DSA; whereas Python? a day is more than enough to study the most basic DSAs.
